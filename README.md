To develop the frontend for the "Access Key Manager" project, you'll need to create user interfaces for both School IT Personnel and Micro-Focus Admin dashboards. Here's a high-level overview of what each dashboard should include:

**School IT Personnel Dashboard:**
1. **Login/Signup Page:**
   - Forms for users to log in or sign up with their email and password.
   - Include links for password reset if the user forgets their password.

2. **Dashboard Page:**
   - Display a list of access keys granted to the user.
   - Group access keys by status: active, expired, or revoked.
   - Show details for each access key, including its status, procurement date, and expiry date.
   - Disable the option to request a new key if the user already has an active key.

**Micro-Focus Admin Dashboard:**
1. **Login Page:**
   - A login form for Micro-Focus Admin to access their dashboard.

2. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Display a list of all access keys generated on the platform.
   - Include options to manually revoke access keys.
   - Show details for each access key, such as its status, procurement date, and expiry date.
   - Provide an input field to search for keys by school email.
   - Implement an endpoint to display details of the active key for a given school email.

**General Frontend Considerations:**
1. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the frontend is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.

2. **User-friendly Interface:**
   - Design an intuitive interface with clear navigation and user-friendly interactions.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling for invalid inputs, failed login attempts, and other potential errors.

4. **Integration with Backend:**
   - Connect frontend components with backend APIs to fetch data and perform actions.

5. **Styling and Branding:**
   - Apply consistent styling and branding throughout the frontend to maintain a cohesive look and feel.

6. **Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of the frontend to ensure functionality and usability across different scenarios.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Provide documentation or user guides to assist users in navigating and using the frontend interface.

By implementing these components and considerations, you can create a frontend for the "Access Key Manager" project that meets the requirements and provides a seamless user experience for both School IT Personnel and Micro-Focus Admin users.
